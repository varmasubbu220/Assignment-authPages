*As per the instructions in the PDF, React or similar technologies were not mentioned.
 Therefore, I have developed this project using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* This project uses session storage to store registered users.
 Passwords are stored in plain text in this example, which is not secure. 
 In a real-world application, password hashing should be implemented.
*Also I wrote all code in single file which is not preffered in realtime
